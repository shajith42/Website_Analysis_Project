##  Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Understanding
- Loaded raw website analytics data.  
- Reviewed the structure and columns.  
- Understood the problem statement and defined goals.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaned raw data: fixed headers and missing values.  
- Formatted columns with correct data types.  
- Extracted and created new columns like `Date` and `Hour`.  
- Used `df.describe()` to explore statistical properties.

### Step 3: Problem Solving & Insight Generation

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer key business questions:

#### Sessions and Users Over Time
- Time-based trend analysis to understand traffic patterns.

#### Total Users by Channel Group
- Identified which marketing channels bring in the most users.

#### Average Engagement Time by Channel
- Measured how long users stay on site, by source.

#### Engagement Rate Distribution by Channel
- Visualized how users engage across various channels.

#### Engaged vs Non-Engaged Sessions
- Compared session types for user interaction insights.

#### Most Active Traffic Hours
- Heatmap analysis of traffic across the day.

#### Engagement Rate vs Sessions Over Time
- Correlated session volume with engagement effectiveness.
